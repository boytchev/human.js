## Posture Licence
	
	
You can use this software to generate 3D figures. You are allowed:

* **to freely use the figutes** in anything: games, movies, web sites, publications, presentations, printed materials, company logos, billboards, adverticements;
* **to modify, adapt and build** on the figures in any imaginable way;
* **to release your work** with the figures under any licence of your choice.


However, we hope that:
	
* the figures are not used in any immoral, illegal, misleading or diceptive context;
* you understand that anyone could recreate the exact same figures, that you have already created with pasion and love;
* you find this software useful.
