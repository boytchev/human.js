### Usage

This is the fifth incarnation of the mannequin figure library. The first one was
implemented in Elica. The second one was implemented in C/C++ and OpenGL. The
third and fourth ones were implemented in ES5 JS/Three.js. The fifth version
uses ES6 modules. Since its first incarnation, mannequin.js is used in the
course *Fundamentals of Computer Graphics* for Computer Sciences undergraduate
students from the [Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics](https://www.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/en) at [Sofia University](https://www.uni-sofia.bg/index.php/eng).
